<b>Contemporary “mythology” may be defined as beliefs held by one group about itself or 
others, ambiguous in their degree of truth. <i><i>No Love in Alaska</i></i> is an 
assessment of social and political mythologies of modern America. However, rather 
than attempting to deconstruct and clarify, this project merges myths of opposing groups 
to create a reconciliatory fictitious reality that still exists within the uncertain 
realm of myth. Depicted in this photo series are the characters of this imagined setting. 
With these characters <i><i>No Love in Alaska</i></i> aims to analyze and destabilize the 
myths through recontextualization. By superimposing these myths on symbols of our identities, 
the project functions as a self-portrait.</b></br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the 2016 elections, this project provided 
a means for us to explore our identities as Pittsburgh natives defined by, and in opposition 
to, the prevailing conservative culture of suburban and rural Appalachia. Throughout childhood, 
our perception of these areas was largely colored by the confederate flags, homophobic tendencies, 
and racist attitudes we observed surrounding our city. <i>No Love in Alaska</i> began as a critical 
analysis of this culture focusing on the hypermasculine American exceptionalist, expansionist, 
“rugged individualist” ideals that we recognized as the ideological foundation of modern, 
politically conservative Americans. We identified Alaska, abstracted by popular media throughout 
the 20th century as the last great American frontier, as the symbol of these ideals and, in turn, 
of the conservative culture of rural Appalachia. The university (academia), perceived as a haven 
of progressive thought, and omnipresent in Pittsburgh as an employer and educator, became a 
symbol of our contrasting identities.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly became clear, however, that both symbols were 
based on the simplistic ideas of the “liberal elite” university and Alaska as the “expansive, 
uninhabited wild,” waiting to be “conquered.” Though much of America’s initial cultural 
expansion into Alaska was carried out by rugged individualists under the banner of commercial 
exploration, the land exists today as a complex amalgamation of cultures, peoples, and policies 
that resist simple, politically polar associations. Likewise, our linking of many universities 
to inclusivity and progressive thought developed despite their statuses as corrupt institutions 
and ethically questionable investors (paralleling the new US government). The inherent fallacies 
in each symbolic association revealed that our assumptions were largely based on popular, reductive 
representations of political groups, institutions, ideologies, and cultures. Because these cultivated 
representations are incomplete, and their degrees of accuracy remain unclear, they may be defined as modern myths.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, instead of focusing our project on the disentanglement of truth from fiction, we were interested in the mechanism of imagination as a tool for “othering” social and political groups. We chose to retain the myths of Alaska and the university as central themes in the project as means to document our internalized mythologies while simultaneously analyzing our own identities – Alaska became the mythologized symbol of Appalachia, while academia functioned as a more literal representation of our identities as students and the children of university faculty.  We created Blue Creek University, set in the fictitious Blue Creek, Alaska, as a fusion of these primary myths. This creative synthesis continues the process of imagination and explores the selected symbols without leaving the liminal realm of mythology (existing between absolute truth and fiction). Furthermore, by superimposing our internalized myths onto symbols of our identity <i>No Love in Alaska</i> became, in part, a self-portrait.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To depict Blue Creek University we created a series of photos showing individual students in wilderness settings. Each character wears the tee shirt of a different university group, recalling the performance of identity inherent in clothing, and connecting the character’s identity to their status as a university affiliate. Selections of academic literature accompany the photographs of each character, providing a foundation upon which viewers may imagine the persona of each student.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To play the roles of students, we recruited three Appalachian natives whose black, mixed-race, female, and non-binary identities all correspond to groups we perceived as oppressed by and unwelcome in the traditional conservative culture of rural Appalachia. Photos were taken in Western Maryland and Southwestern Pennsylvania.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothing was collected from second hand stores outside of Pittsburgh and modified into fictional student wardrobes through screen printing and physical alteration. We originally considered this repurposing transgressive, but as the nature of the project developed the act became a reconciliatory gesture towards understanding, literally “putting ourselves in their shoes.” The final form of the work is a mailable booklet, furthering the theme of isolation while introducing a communicative aspect. Isolation is significant both as an intrinsic component of hypermasculine rugged individualism, and as an acknowledgment of the experience of oppressed individuals in the locations documented. The concept of communication is likewise a personal reference to our process as collaborators in different cities, and, as we learned while conducting the project in rural Appalachia, a potential antidote to our internalized mythologies.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the myths at work in <i>No Love in Alaska</i> are the product of our own identities, viewpoints, and observations, investigation of the relationship between myth and identity in modern America is important on a broader scale. The aim of this project is to provide a context for the discussion and consideration of this relationship.</br></br>
